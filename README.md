# K-Means-Clustering-Analysis

This file performs two seperate K Means Cluster Analyses on data from a Financial Institution. The first clustering is built off of demographic information, while the second clustering is built off of values within the dataset.

In the values clustering I will dive deeper into the results and pull key characteristics of each cluster. 

Note: I am using SKLearn to perform the K Means Cluster Analysis.
